# Statistical-Data-Visualization-with-Seaborn-From-UST

1. Produce and customize various chart types with Seaborn

2. Apply feature selection and feature extraction methods with scikit-learn

3. Build a boosted decision tree classifier with XGBoost


**Project Implementation and Takeaways --**

1. Importing Libraries and Data

2. Dropping Correlated Columns from Feature List

3. Classification using XGBoost (minimal feature selection)

4. Univariate Feature Selection

5. Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation

6. Plot CV Scores vs Number of Features Selected

7. Feature Extraction using Principal Component Analysis
